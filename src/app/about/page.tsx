                    Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Frans Filasta Pratama, and I am an experienced professional with a diverse background in both the public and private sectors. With eight years of experience under my belt, I have spent five years working as a government employee and three years in the private sector.</p>
                <p>As a skilled SOA and microservice engineer, I have extensive experience developing complex systems that require a high level of expertise. My background in Information Systems, which I studied at Sriwijaya University, has equipped me with a deep understanding of software engineering principles.</p>

                <p>Aside from my professional pursuits, I have a passion for photography, which has been a hobby of mine for many years. Lately, I have been drawn to the world of UI/UX design and am excited to explore this field further.</p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect.</p>
