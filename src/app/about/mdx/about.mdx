Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Frans Filasta Pratama, and I am an experienced professional with a diverse background in both the public and private sectors. With eight years of experience under my belt, I have spent five years working as a government employee and three years in the private sector.

Aside from my professional pursuits, I have a passion for photography, which has been a hobby of mine for many years. Lately, I have been drawn to the world of UI/UX design and am excited to explore this field further.

Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect.
