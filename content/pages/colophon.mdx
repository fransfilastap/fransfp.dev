### [Colophon](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/colophon/)

This page outlines the technical aspect of this website.

---
I built this website mainly to keep me stay relevant in the front-end development world. So this website will be more like my lab.

#### The looks of this website

I'm not a designer, so I copied some elements from [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io)'s website design. I really like his web simplicity.

#### Technology stack

If you're curious what are the technology stacks I used on this website, here is the list:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a popular ReactJS framework to build with server-side rendering and generate static websites.
- [MDX](http://mdxjs.com), I write blog posts on this website using MDX format. MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. I use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to parse `.mdx` in NextJS
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com), a modular and accessible component library for react
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-prisma), a next-generation ORM for any Node.js / Typescript backend (or serverless application and microservices).
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), a serverless MySQL platform to store my blog post views
- I'm using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) to develop this website
- This website deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Everything is open source ❤️.
