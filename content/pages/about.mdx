## Hi üëãüèª

I'm a **full-stack developer**. Welcome to my website.

I‚Äôm currently working as a government officer in Indonesia‚Äôs Ministry of Law and Human Rights.

As a bachelor of Information Systems, I love to get involved in the government‚Äôs digital transformation. This passion is what keeps me from resigning from this role until now. hahaha. Maybe some of you already know the nature of government organization üò¨.

I was a backend developer (SOA Developer) at a major telecommunication company in Indonesia, but I have always been interested in arts and it drives me to go deeper into front-end stuff like CSS, and ReactJS.

Besides coding, I play with my kid in my free time (of course! haha), taking photographs with my analog camera/mirrorless or just with my mobile phone.  I love reading and watching movies/series. I love games too. I really love Xenoblade Chronicles, Mario, and Zelda.

If you‚Äôd like to get in touch with me, send me an [email](mailto:fransfilastap@live.com).

## How I built this website

I built this website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a ReactJS framework, and [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) -- modular and accessible component library for react. Blogs and this about page were written using Markdown.
I‚Äôm using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as a database ORM to store and retrieve views data and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) as a serverless MySQL database.
