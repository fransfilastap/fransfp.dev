My name is Frans. I am a **full-stack developer**.

I’m currently working as a government officer in Indonesia’s Ministry of Law and Human Rights.

As a bachelor of Information Systems, I love to get involved in the government’s digital transformation. I found joy in it.

I was a backend developer (SOA Developer) at a major telecommunication company in Indonesia, but I have always been interested in arts and it drives me to go deeper into front-end stuff like CSS, and ReactJS.

Besides coding, I play with my kid in my free time (of course! haha), taking photographs with my analog camera/mirrorless or just with my mobile phone. I love reading and watching movies/series. I love games too. I really love Xenoblade Chronicles, Mario, and Zelda.

If you’d like to get in touch with me, send me an [email](mailto:fransfilastap@live.com).
